Architecting with Google Compute Engine Specialization
======================================================

Networking
----------

- The default quota for each project is five networks but you can simply request additional quota using the GCP console. These networks do not have IP ranges but are simply a construct of all of the individual IP addresses and services within that network. GCP networks are global spending all available regions across the world that I showed earlier. So you can have one network that later exists anywhere in the world
- 3 types of networks: **Default** (The default network is actually an auto mode network), **Auto**, and **Custom**. Can convert an **Auto** mode network to a **Custom** mode network
- Avoid creating large subnets. Overly large subnets are more likely to cause site arrange collisions when using multiple network interfaces and VPC network peering or when configuring a VPN or other connections to an on-premises network. Therefore, do not scale your subnet beyond what you actually need
- FQDN is [hostname].[zone].c.[project-id].internal e.g. `my-server.us-central1-a.c.guestbook-15617.internal`
- Internal DNS resolver, provided as part of Compute Engine (169.254.169.254), configured for use on instance via DHCP, providing answer for internal and extenal addresses
- A **bastion** host provides an external facing point of entry into a network containing private network instances. This host can provide a **single-point of fortification or audit** and can be started and stopped to enable or disable inbound SSH communication from the Internet

Identities and Roles
--------------------

- In GCP resource hierarchy, each resource has exactly one parent
- The organization represents your company. The folder could represent your department. Projects represent a trust boundary within your company. Roles represent an abstraction of job roles
- Always select the smallest scope that's necessary for the task in order to reduce your exposure to risk

Compute Engine
--------------

- Cloud Console commands:
** `free`
** `suo dmidecode --type 17`
** `nproc`
** `lscpu`
