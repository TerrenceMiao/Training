Assessment Test
---------------

- Machine type, boot disk image or container image, zone, and labels are all configuration parameters or attributes of a VM
- **gsutil mb** is the specific command for creating, or making, a bucket
- Create a lifecycle management configuration policy specifying an age of 90 days and SetStorageClass as nearline is the most efficient way to meet object management policy requirement.

- **gsutil rsync** to synchronize the contents of the two buckets
- VPCs are **Global** resources. Google operates a global network, and VPCs are resources that can span that global network
- **gcloud** by default will retry a failed network operation and will wait a long time before each retry. The time to wait is calculated using a truncated binary exponential back-off strategy
- Only Google Spanner and Cloud SQL databases support transactions and have a SQL interface. Datastore has transactions but does not support fully compliant SQL; it has a SQL-like query language. Cloud Storage does not support transactions or SQL
- App Engine is a PaaS that allows developers to deploy full applications without having to manage servers or clusters. Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine require management of servers. Cloud Functions is suitable for short-running but not full applications
- BigQuery is designed for petabyte-scale analytics and provides a SQL interface
- Cloud Dataflow allows for stream and batch processing of data and is well suited for this kind of ETL work. Dataproc is a managed Hadoop and Spark service that is used for big data analytics
- Preemptible virtual machines may be shut down at any time but will always be shut down after running 24 hours by Google
- **Organizations, folders, and projects** are the components used to manage an organizational hierarchy. **Buckets, directories, and subdirectories** are used to organize storage
- Cloud Dataproc is the managed Spark service. Cloud Dataflow is for stream and batch processing of data, BigQuery is for analytics
