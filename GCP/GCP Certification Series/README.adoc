GCP Certification Series
========================

For Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer.

Basic Knowledge
---------------

- The project number and project ID are unique across the Google Cloud Platform
- Name such as **Google** or **SSL** cannot be used for the project name
- gcloud projects create [PROJECT_ID] [--organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID]. Project ID must **start with a lowercase letter**, and can contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens, and must be between 6 and 30 characters.
- Project owners can restore a deleted project within the 30-day recovery period that starts when the project is shut down. Restoring a project returns it to the state it was in before it was shut down. Cloud Storage resources are deleted before the 30-day period ends, and may not be fully recoverable.

- Standard user access types or Primitive Roles:
** Browser (Beta)
** Editor
** Owner
** Viewer

- To place a **lien** on a project protecting GCP project accidentally delete by any owners and administrator, untile **lien** is revoked
- gcloud alpha resource-manager liens list

- IAM policy can be set at the organization level, folder level, project level, or (in some cases) resource level
- Permissions that were inherited from the original parent will be lost when the project is moved to a new folder. Permissions set at the destination folder will be inherited by the project as it is moved
