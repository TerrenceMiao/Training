GCP Certification Series
========================

For Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer.

Basic Knowledge
---------------

- The project number and project ID are unique across the Google Cloud Platform
- Name such as **Google** or **SSL** cannot be used for the project name
- gcloud projects create [PROJECT_ID] [--organization=ORGANIZATION_ID | --folder=FOLDER_ID]. Project ID must **start with a lowercase letter**, and can contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens, and must be between 6 and 30 characters.
- Project owners can restore a deleted project within the 30-day recovery period that starts when the project is shut down. Restoring a project returns it to the state it was in before it was shut down. Cloud Storage resources are deleted before the 30-day period ends, and may not be fully recoverable.

- Standard user access types or Primitive Roles:
** Browser (Beta)
** Editor
** Owner
** Viewer

- Cloud Shell gives 5GB of persistent disk storage in your home directory

- To place a **lien** on a project protecting GCP project accidentally delete by any owners and administrator, untile **lien** is revoked
- gcloud alpha resource-manager liens list
- gcloud beta **interactive**

- IAM policy can be set at the organization level, folder level, project level, or (in some cases) resource level
- Permissions that were inherited from the original parent will be lost when the project is moved to a new folder. Permissions set at the destination folder will be inherited by the project as it is moved

- To use any API need to have valid credentials. To find the keys for authenticating uses of API you can add and remove credentials from the list


Cloud SDK and CLI
-----------------

Managing SDK Components - **General Availability**, **Preview** release, **Alpha**, **Beta** components, _https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/components_

Pricing
-------

- These savings are achieved by:
** **Sustained use discount**: _**More your instances are running bigger discount you will get.**_
** **List price differences**: Google is reducing the price of services and instances according to **Moore’s law** and immediately after the price of any instance or services are reduced they are applied in your monthly billing.
** **Rightsizing recommendations**: Google cloud provides recommendations for compute engine based on the 8 days stack driver monitoring to resize the VM.

Compute Resources
-----------------

- Up to 5 VPC can be added to the project
- Instances in the same VPC communicate in local area network
- Public IP is only used when it has to communicate outside the project
- Compute Engine can automatically generate SSH keys for you and apply them to your Google account, or G Suite account, or **project metadata**
- Shared-core machine types provide one vCPU that is allowed to run for a portion of the time on a single hardware hyper-thread on the host CPU running your instance. Shared-core instances can be more cost-effective for running small, non-resource intensive applications than standard, high-memory or high-CPU machine types
- Bursting happens automatically when your instance requires more physical CPU than originally allocated. During these spikes, your instance will opportunistically take advantage of available physical CPU in bursts. Note that bursts are not permanent and are only possible periodically
- Attach GPUs only to instances with a predefined machine type or custom machine type are able to create in a zone. GPUs are not supported on shared-core machine types or memory-optimized machine types
- Preemption process:
** Compute Engine sends a preemption notice to the instance in the form of **an ACPI G2 Soft Off signal**. You can use a shutdown script to handle the preemption notice and complete cleanup actions before the instance stops
** If the instance does not stop after 30 seconds, Compute Engine sends **an ACPI G3 Mechanical Off signal** to the operating system
** Compute Engine transitions the instance to a **TERMINATED** state

Storage
-------

image::https://miro.medium.com/max/2470/0*-J9gAHSRqWQsDeoo.png[File Storage vs. Block Storage vs. Object Storage]

- Storage Systems:
** **File storage** — files and folders. Performance suffers of certain capacity, like processing power and growth
** **Block storage** — Databases, OS. Using traditional file systems on block storage places explicit or practical operational limits on scaling beyond the petabyte range
** **Object storage** - buckets, multimedia, designed for unstructured data such as media, documents, logs, backups, application binaries, and VM images:
*** Data are stored along with its metadata (**objects in object**) and unique identifier
*** Conceptually they are like a persistent key/value store
*** Perfect solution for backup or archive
*** Real file system layer is obsolete
*** Can be scaled up much easier

Network
-------

image::GCP Certification Series - Internet Provider.png[3 tiers Internet Providers]

- 3 tiers Internet Providers:
** Tier 1 carriers are the movers and shakers of the industry, called as backbone Internet providers
** Tier 2 carriers peer with other networks, but also purchase IP transit for full access to the internet
** Tier 3 carriers strictly purchase IP transit, usually are last mile providers

- **BGP Peering** is an agreement between different Service Providers. It is an EBGP neighborship between different Service Providers to send BGP traffic between them without paying upstream Service Provider

- Few of the resources in GCP are global, others may be restricted by region or zone
** Global Resources:
*** Images
*** Snapshots
*** VPC Network
*** Firewalls
*** Routes
** Regional Resources:
*** Static external IP addresses
*** Subnets
** Zonal Resources:
*** Instances (VMs)
*** Persistent Disks

_Can attach a disk from one instance to another within the same zone, but cannot do this across zones. Since images and snapshots are Global Resources, can use these across zones in the same region._

- Addressing Methods
** Unicast
** Multicast
** Broadcast
** Geocast
** Anycast

- Load Balancer
** Distribute load-balanced resources in single or multiple regions
** Meet your high availability requirements
** Put your resources behind a single anycast IP address
** Scale your resources up or down with intelligent Autoscaling
** Use Cloud CDN for optimal content delivery
