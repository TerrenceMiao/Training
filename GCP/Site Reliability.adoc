Develop Sample SLOs and SLIs
----------------------------

**Service Kevel Indicators (SLIs)**, **Service Kevel Objectives (SLOs)**, and **Service Kevel Agreements (SLAs)**

Most services consider **request latency**, how long it takes to return a response to a request, the **error rate**, often expressed as a fraction of all requests received, and **system throughput**, typically measured in requests per second, **availability**, the fraction of the time that a service is usable, often defined in terms of the fraction of well-formed requests that succeed, **durability**, the likelihood that data will be retained over a long period of time, is equally important for data storage systems.

The measurements are often aggregated: i.e., raw data is collected over a measurement window and then turned into a rate, average, or percentile.

Configure Latency SLI
---------------------

Stackdriver -> Monitoring then in the new tab, select Alerting -> Create a Policy:
